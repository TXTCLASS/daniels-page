Daniel S. personal page.

This public repo tracks the page content for my personal homepage. It is mirrored on my web server. If you like my site layout and want to steal it, you can fork this project and make it your own. However, please don't try to impersonate me.
Let's face it, the only reason you're here is if you're stalking me, or trying to find embarassing mistakes I've made while trying to modify the site content. If you do find a mistake, or if you want me to remove/add some page content, feel free to add an issue.
